<h1>How to make an apple pie ?</h1>

<p> 1- Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl. </p>
<p> 2- Rub in the margarine or butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. </p>
<p> 3 - Add the cold water to the flour mixture. Using a knife, mix the water into the flour, using your hand to firm up the mixture.</p>
<p> 4 - Divide the pastry into two halves. Take one half and roll it out so that it is big enough to cover an 20cm/8in enamel or aluminium plate. Trim the edges with a knife using the edge of the plate as your guide.</p>
<p> 5 - Cover the pastry with the stewed apples and sprinkle with sugar to taste.</p>
<p> 6 - Roll out the other half of the pastry. Moisten the edge of the bottom layer of pastry and place the second piece on top.</p>
<p> 7 - Press down on the pastry edges, making sure that they are properly sealed. Trim off any excess pastry with a knife in a downward motion, again using the plate as your guide.</p>
<p> 8 - Flute the edges with a pinching action using your fingers and thumb.</p>
<p> 9 - Prick the surface of the pastry lightly before placing the pie in the oven. Cook for 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p> 10 - When the pie is cooked it should move slightly on the plate when gently shaken.</p>
<p> 11 - Slide on to a serving plate, dust with caster sugar and serve.</p>
<p> Last step:  Enjoy the apple pie!! </p>
